            <h2>A Place for Women To Share Their Stories Through Blogs</h2>
            <p>Growing up as a woman we hear a lot of things from our mother or our grandmother. 
            They teach us how to be a woman, they teach us in such a way that being a woman is a task filled with 
            duties and various kinds of responsibilities. We grow building a grace inside us which shows as the woman 
            outside Society had made particular things accessible for us and decided what we can do and what we can’t.
            Even in the year 2020 as women are rising up in the sky society is trying to pull them down and trying to show 
            what they are made for. When women are born, they do not come with an instruction manual that has to be followed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They are trying to make their existence on this planet as someone they want to be. When people talk about feminism, 
             some listeners think that women want to be treated in a special way, but we don’t want that. We don’t want more we 
            just want the same respect that people give to a man, we don’t want their masculinity, we have our own beauty but
            we don’t have our own respect. ‘Dear Zari’ is a book written by the author ‘Zarghuna Kargar’. In this book the author 
            showed horrifying and scarring incidents of women that happened in Afghanistan in 90’s and before. 
            Through this book it was shown that women were treated worse than animals but it also showed how strong they were
            and how they tried to stay alive. This book actually showed that how strong women are from inside and from outside. 
            They struggle but they never stopped</p>
            <br>
            <p>Women have to prove themselves at every stage of their life. We can’t be someone we actually want to be because 
            eventually society title it as “shame for woman.” Things are hard to change but we try hard every time we have to.
            We are still questioned about things like, not changing our surname after marriage, wearing short dresses, working late at night, 
            travelling alone and a lot of another questions but the answer is only one that, we want to live a life as we want to make ourselves happy.  
            Women of this generation are trying so hard to make a better future for the next ones, don’t think of us as just a woman, don’t expect 
            us to be a perfect lady, let us be the way we want to be, let us fly as high we want, support us when we want it 
            and respect us as a woman nothing more or nothing less. </p>
