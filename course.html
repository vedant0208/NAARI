        <h3>"SNEHA"</h3>
        <p>Working with the children and women was very rewarding and they are fantastic! 
        Its worth making lesson plan through as we were surprised how much control we had. 
        It was a great week though, the host family made us feel at home and Jaipur is brilliant place to explore. 
        Thank you VWI! Challenging but well worth the effort.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stories-col">
        <h3>"Shruti Sharma"</h3>
        <p>The women on the programme were unbelievably enthusiastic and eager to learn. 
        It was such a joy to both teach and help them in skills development program. 
        I hope they enjoyed themselves as much as I did. 
        The family at the house welcomes us and were able to help if we needed anything. 
        It was a great insight into both the lives of an Indian family and the children.</p>

    <div class="stories-col">
        <h3>"Yushsvi Acharya"</h3>
        <p>I have absolutely loved my time volunteering with VWI. The people are helpful and kind, and have been extremely welcoming. 
        The accommodation with the host family is excellent. You really feel like part of the family. 
        I even had the opportunity to work with the elephants as well as my own, project women empowerment.</p>
